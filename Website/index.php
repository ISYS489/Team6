<h1>Welcome to team 6's Site</h1>
<p>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This website was created to allow students to rate political events.
Students along with professors and university adminsitrators may create events. 
The ratings students provide will assign a level of civility to these events.
Students will enroll in courses within a specified University, allowing professors to view progress.
The general public is welcome to view events and ratings,
but will have to be accepted into the general university upon registration to make any posts.
